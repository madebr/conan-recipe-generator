# conan-recipe-generator

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/conan-recipe-generator.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/conan-recipe-generator)

Conan-recipe-generator creates recipes for c/c++ source releases.

## How to use

```python
$ conan-recipe-generator --url "$PATH_TO_RELEASE" 
```

The script will (try to) detect the name and version of the package and create a folder named after the deteced name in the current working directory.
This folder will contain the recipe.

This script will not generate a working recipe if it detects multiple build systems.
Code to build with all build systems will be generated, but you will have to modify the script manually.
The heuristics might always fail.
